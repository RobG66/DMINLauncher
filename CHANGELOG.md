# Changelog

All notable changes to DMINLauncher will be documented in this file.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-01-28

### Fixed
- ✅ **Linux Path Separators** - Relative paths now always use forward slashes (`/`), config files are portable between Windows and Linux
- ✅ **Subdirectory Mod Paths** - Mods in subdirectories now display and restore with their full relative path instead of bare filename
- ✅ **WAD Search Case Sensitivity** - File extension matching (`.wad`, `.WAD`, `.pk3`, etc.) is case-insensitive on Linux; saved path lookups also use case-insensitive comparison
- ✅ **Show Maps Button** - Now displays all map names from the selected IWAD instead of truncating at 5
- ✅ **Show Maps Visibility** - Button correctly appears whenever a base game is selected (any valid IWAD has at least one map)
- ✅ **Version Display** - AssemblyVersion was out of sync with Version; title bar now correctly shows 1.3.0

## [1.2.0] - 2026-01-27


### Changed
- 🗂️ **Simplified Mod Management** - Removed Total Conversions tab, unified all WADs/mods in one location
- 🔄 **ResetSettings Behavior** - Now preserves engine paths, WAD paths, and selected IWAD
- 💾 **Save/Load Logic** - SaveSettings/LoadSettings now handle .cfg files, not .gzdoom presets
